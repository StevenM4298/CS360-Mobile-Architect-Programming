•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?


The primary user need that was the focus of the app is to provide an application to allow different users to track their weight compared to a pre-determined goal of their choice. The user needed the ability to login and view their most recent daily weight, as well as add a new weight. This weight should be compared to a goal that they set themselves and be reflected in a progress bar. Finally, a database/grid for the user to view their progress and/or history and the weight they entered on each day. 


•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?


A login page was required first, as well as a function to register as a new user if you did not already have credentials. Next was a homepage. I decided to utilize a homepage because I thought that much of the information could be easily accessible on one screen without the need of a separate screen for each. This allowed for better performance and ease of access for the user. From the homepage the user can view their weight, add a new weight, view progress, and access the calendar/grid page for additional details. 


•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?


I started by thinking of the app in a very iterative manner. For example, I focused first on the login page. Once that was functional I began working on the homepage. The homepage was the most crucial because it housed most of the information. I started with the primary functions such as displaying the date and giving the ability to add a new weight. From here I wanted to give access to setting a goal. I chose to do the goal next because I wanted to establish this first before coding for the progress bar. This is because I knew the progress bar would only work if it knew a goal that it should compare against the daily weight. Once this was completed I knew I could create the sms notification, as it only prompts when a new goal is added. In the future, I plan to do this process much better by having more planning and utilizing pencil and paper to map out my screens first. 


•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
To test if the code was functional I prioritized certain elements, running the code and trying different kinds of input to ensure it worked, then moved onto another element. Once I tested one element, I would always go back and make sure the previous element still works and ensure the changes I made didn’t create a new bug in a previously functional method. This way of testing revealed to me that often times making a correction to one can likely hinder another element. The difficult job is to find a solution that balances between all the elements and ensures they are all functional together. 


•	Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?


I had to innovate in the later stages of the app development due to not doing enough or adequate planning. I found that some of the buttons did not work properly in the flow of the app once I had already completed the .xml activity files. Several times I had to shift the layout if I discovered it did not work properly or as best it could from a UI perspective. 


•	In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?


I was very happy with the ability of my application to accept a new weight and display it in a large, designated section that was easy for the user to see and understand. In addition, setting a goal, viewing the progress, and receiving a notification once the goal was reached are all areas that I think my application performed well and I was excited to see them come to life.
